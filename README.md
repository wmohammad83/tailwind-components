# Tailwind Components

## Aim
The aim of this repository is log the progress of my YouTube video where I will be creating different components using Tailwindcss. We will start with a template which we will duplicate and modify to create our components. This will allow us to join these components together into a full website which you will then be able to modify as you please.
